                        <p class="short-text">A 3D model of The Music Pavilion was developed in Rhino 3D and afterwards animated in Twinmotion. Theoretically, 
                            this Pavilion was supposed to be situated inside Holland Park in Surrey. This was an 
                            academic project for IAT 233 Spatial Design.</p>
                            <p class="short-text">Objective: Apply a variety of representations including sketching, digital and physical modeling to communicate their design intent and solution to the audience/client. Principles and elements from the course must be utilized. The purpose of this final project is to apply 
                                human experience and human factors as well as syntactic language in the design 
                                of a building for a specific context. </p>

                    <p class="long-text">This project was broken down into 4 weeks having a deliverable due each week. The work, which included anything from mockup sketches
                         to research on design purpose, was equally divided between my group members and I.</p>

                        <h3>My Role</h3>
                        <p class="long-text">My responsibility for this project was to fine-tune the 3D model's
                             dimensions, particularly the details around the outer wall, as well as the animations and the development 
                             of Holland Park's environment in Twinmotion. Low fidelity sketches and a Google Maps overhead 
                            were used in the 3D model's details to accurately represent Holland Park in Surrey, British Columbia.</p>

                        <p class="long-text">During this week, we began to create mockup sketches for the pavilion. We had many iterations leading to our final design. This was the most challenging part of the project due to the fact that we all had to agree on one design choice. Its hard making a decision when there
                             are different opinions within the group. The way we ended up deciding on a design was to create a 
                             design that had elements from each.</p>

                    <p class="short-text">We began working on our model in Rhino 3D. 
                        Perfect calculations needed to be made to make sure our pavilion does not exceed the size requirement.</p>  
                        <p class="short-text">
                            It was challenging for the group to construct the pavilion in Rhino 3D because only one person can be in control at once. A collaboration function would have been very helpful but is not there in Rhino 3D. Each member of the group 
                            was given the task of working on the 3D model and adding to on to the file each day to combat this issue.

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p class="long-text">The pavilion was placed in a real-world location as the project's last step. The 3D model 
                        was imported into Twinmotion to do this. We were able to generate a realistic scene of Holland Park using Twinmotion,
                         complete with people, walking paths, and weather. Finally, in order to achieve the project's objective, we used human 
                         factors and experiences to design a pavilion that would maximize the visitors interaction. 
                        To complete the project, we created a one-minute cinematic video showcasing our pavilion in Twinmotion.</p>
