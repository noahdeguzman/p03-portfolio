                        <p class="short-text">Imagine NFTs in the shape of contemporary collector posters. I founded Posterized Kicks, a
                             freelance business, in the hopes that social media marketing techniques would add value to my artwork. On April 20, 2021, 
                            Posterized Kicks made its formal debut on Instagram, releasing a constrained number of 4 
                            distinct designs in the first month.</p>

                        <h3>Goal</h3>
                        <p class="short-text">The goal for Posterized Kicks is to spread awareness to the community on upcoming sneaker releases. I want these posters to be exclusive and sold by major companies such as Nike, Jordan and Footlocker.</p>

                        <p class="short-text">After Effects was used to make a few of the Instagram stories' effective and captivating posts. Each story would last between 3 and 6 seconds, so I had to think of creative ways to grab the audience's attention.</p>   
                        <p class="short-text">I applied the knowledge that I have with After Effects from my IAT 100 Digital Image Design course at Simon Fraser University. This course has taught me the basics of After Effects however, I needed to branch off and independently learn more advanced tricks.</p>

                        <h3>Improvements</h3>
                    <p class="long-text">I've improved a lot since I initially started doing the posters, especially in 
                        terms of how I manage my time and sketch each shoe. I'm becoming more comfortable 
                        using Adobe Illustrator, and I'm constantly looking for methods to use the program 
                        more effectively. I'm now using exploring Adobe Illustrator on my iPad, and I find 
                        that I draw far better there than I do on the desktop version. Below is a comparison between 
                        the same shoe from 2021 and 2022. In an effort to reduce the amount of time it takes to 
                        draw, I redrew the image on my iPad. By doing this, I believe the lines seem cleaner 
                        and the drawing time was reduced by 30 minutes. Additionally, I altered the colours 
                        to make it more accurate and vivid. In general, I am always looking for ways to 
                        increase my productivity.</p>

                        <h3>The Posters</h3>
                        <p class="long-text">Posterized Kicks posters add personality and flare wherever they go. They are hung up on many walls but one that was a big
                             achievement to me was being featured at Stay Fresh in Metrotown, Burnaby, BC and on their Instagram page.</p>

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p class="short-text">I am really happy that I started my freelance business since it has helped me become a designer in the real world. It is extremely motivating to communicate with people who have similar interests to me and to bring like-minded people together. This project has greatly enhanced my Adobe Illustrator abilities. I had no idea how stressful owning a small business would be. This helped me develop my abilities by teaching me how to manage various business 
                            components independently, such as social media posts, product advertising, and financial planning.</p>
